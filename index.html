        <p>My name is Luca, I'm a software engineer based in Milan, and I'm currently working at <a href="https://truelayer.com">TrueLayer</a>.</p>
<p>My main area of expertise is backend development, specifically in designing, implementing and integrating APIs. I have experience working on cloud-based environments (mostly AWS) with distributed systems and microservices, mainly built upon Java and .NET stack.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in DevOps and related technologies and methodologies: I'm familiar with Kubernetes, I obtained CKAD certification in 2022 and AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate certification in 2023.</p>
<p>When I'm not at work, I like doing sports (football and running being my favourites), cooking and I'm really passionate about wine (I'm currently studying to become sommelier).</p>
